I found [rrrgggbbb.com](http://www.rrrgggbbb.com/) when I was looking for the original set of useless websites in 2012, it's simplicity and quirkiness immediately made me smile, as well as the thought that someone could love the color space enough to build a tribute to it. Back then, it was built in flash, but as with much of the internet, it's received a flashy HTML5 update down the line!

It's creator, [Ewoudt Boonstra](http://mrboonstra.com/) now runs his own studio, showcasing an amazing depth of creativity and artistic flair.

**What were the circumstances behind creating your site?**

Initially I didnâ€™t have the intention to create a site. It all started with a spontaneous design that I made for the RGB letters. After designing it I thought that it would be nice to add some animation to the letters and then, for the full immersive experience, I asked [Rimer London](http://rimerlondon.com/) to create the sound.

What started as a useless design became a useless website.  
&nbsp;

**What came first, the domain or the code & settle on the domain?**

Once I had figured out that I wanted to make a homage to the colours red green and blue, the domain and the code came simultaneously.

I wanted the domain to visually mimic the sound of the site so I settled for [rrrgggbbb.com](http://www.rrrgggbbb.com/).

Long enough to stand out, short enough to remember.  
&nbsp;

**What is the weirdest thing that has come from owning & running such a "unique not really having a purpose" site?**

The site hes been incredibly popular (mainly because of it being featured on The Useless Web), but out of the millions of visitors, there was only one person ever emailed me.
She was asking me to recreate the same thing but she wanted me to replace RGB with her first name.
I politely declined.  
&nbsp;

**Was there anything surprising you learned while building rrrgggbbb?**

[rrrgggbbb.com](http://www.rrrgggbbb.com/) is a homage to RGB (Red, Green, Blue) the colours used by screens to show us the internet.

I got a lot of questions from people asking me if I was working on a CMYK version but Cyan Magenta Yellow and Black are colours used for print, they do not come across on screens.
I talked about this with my friend and graphic designer Anthony Burrill and he suggested to make a poster instead.

People that purchased the [poster](https://www.instagram.com/p/BNW0Pi8AjfS/) got a free link to [cccmmmyyykkk.com](http://cccmmmyyykkk.com/), the digital version of the poster.

What I learned is that people like useless stuff and that people are willing to hang posters of useless stuff on their walls.

**What were the circumstances behind creating your site?**

The idea of an infinite horse came to me in 2014, when I first heard that `.horse` was going to be a TLD. I joked about creating a website called infinite.horse. In 2015 we participated in the "Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon", which was organized by some friends of ours, so the time to make infinite.horse was nigh (or neigh, if you prefer).

**What came first, the domain or the code?**

The domain. The scrolling code was a quick hack by Kyle using an infinite scroll library by Facebook -- the best part is how `legs.html` works.

**How did you settle on the domain?**

At the hackathon some of the sponsors gave coupons for discounts on domain registration and hosting. Either `infinite.horse` was already taken or too expensive, so I brainstormed some alternatives and polled other attendees for which sounded best. `Endless.horse` obviously won.

**How long ago did you launch the site / what are you working on now?**

We launched the site in 2015. Since then, I started a PhD in Electrical Engineering (Kyle was already in his first year of a math PhD), and we're both close to graduating. Also, fun fact: we're getting married this May. Well, maybe. The coronavirus situation might throw a wrench into our plans.

**What is the weirdest thing that has come from owning/running such a unique-not-really-having-a-purpose site?**

The press coverage and popularity were unexpected, and we had no idea we were part of a nascent meme. Some of my favorites include hours-long youtube videos dedicated to people scrolling on endless.horse, being included in a lecture at the Parsons School of Design, and a request from a student in Germany that we add https functionality to the site (which I eventually did, see secure.endless.horse). As I mentioned, we're PhD students so it's been kind of funny being more known for this website than our academic research.

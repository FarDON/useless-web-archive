[The Pigeon](https://thepigeon.org/) is one of the most perplexing sites on the useless web, I have done a lot of digging and haven't been able to come up with any information. I was under the impression to have a `.org` domain you needed to be an organization.

&nbsp;  
Who is the pigeon, and what do they want?

If ANYONE has any information on this site, I have a lot of questions. Please send me a hot tip.
